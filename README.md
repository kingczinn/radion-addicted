# 🚀 Radion Addicted - Todo List DevOps Project

## 📋 Project Overview

### 📝 App Description
A web-based todo list where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It includes a backend API (handling CRUD operations with a lightweight database like SQLite or MongoDB) and a frontend for user interaction. This is simple enough to focus on DevOps without getting bogged down in app logic.

### 🎯 Why This Project?
It's scalable for DevOps demos—easy to containerize, test, and deploy. You can extend it later (e.g., add user auth or persistence).
